# We The North
## The phenomenon sweeping through Canada!

Its no secret that the Toronto Raptors marketing strategy is one of a kind. The history of their brand identity was however changed with the introduction of 'We The North'.

“We weren’t just branding the Raptors, we were branding Canadian basketball,” is what Sid Lee had to say on the topic when asked about the fame that We The North has garnered over the past few years, especially in the last few months with the Raptors winning the NBA for the first time ever. 

**But what does We The North really mean?**


In all honesty, it means whatever you want it to mean. Essentially its a phrase that allows people to express their proud Canadian identity. It has transcended beyond the borders of basketball and is commonly used for any winning moment the country experiences.
